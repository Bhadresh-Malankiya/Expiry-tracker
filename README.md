# Expiry-tracker
> It is a project which tracks the date of expiration of products and sends you an email when a product has expired
## Usage        
- Install xampp in your pc (Or lamp in Linux)
- start xampp/lamp and start mysql server for database
- create database name demo and create table inside users and fields are username , password and email.
- you can add an extra field id and time for current time stamp and id is autoincrement.
This is basically how the database works...

#### Author's note:

This is basic template and I know it needs improvement but as a beginner in web development, it is best example to connecting database and creating site using html , css and php.<br>
I implemented log in and sign up page you can add data to localhost mysql server and start particular session through log in using same and it's very simple coding .
