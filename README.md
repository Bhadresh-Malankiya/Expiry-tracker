Is basic template and i know it needed too much improvement but as a starter at web development is best example to connecting database and creating site using html , css and php.
i implemented log in and sign up page you can add data to localhost mysql server and start particular session thru log in using same and it's very simple coding .

1. install xampp in your pc
2. start xampp and start mysql server for database
3. create database name demo and create table inside users and fields are username ,password and email.
4. you can ad extra field id and time for current time stamp and id is autoincrement.
is basically how database works..
Thank you
